        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Alexa, Google, or Siri: Are they listening to our conversations?</h1>
        <div class="noticia">
            <p>The viral video alleging that Amazon's smart speaker records snippets of audio without the wake word "Alexa" raises concerns about privacy and the accuracy of voice recognition systems. While Amazon asserts that no audio is stored or sent to the cloud without the wake word being detected, the experience of criminologist María Aperador suggests otherwise. Aperador discovered instances where recordings lacked the wake word, prompting her to raise the issue on social media.

                Experts like CSIC researcher David Arroyo suggest that false positives in the wake word detection process might explain these recordings. Machine learning systems like those used by Amazon speakers incorporate various elements to improve performance, but their precision and false positive rates are crucial. Accidental activations in smart speakers, as highlighted by a study from Ruhr University Bochum and the Max Planck Institute, underscore the importance of addressing false positives.
                
                Smart speakers constantly monitor for wake words like "Alexa," "ok, Google," or "hey, Siri," using algorithms to detect acoustic patterns corresponding to these terms. This monitoring, while necessary for functionality, raises privacy concerns. However, experts clarify that the technology typically only processes sound waves to detect wake words and doesn't extract additional data. Users can opt-out of storing recordings in their privacy settings, mitigating some concerns.
                
                Despite assurances from companies like Amazon, users may still feel uncomfortable with the idea of constant monitoring and the potential for data breachess or misuse of recordings. The risk of detailed user profiling also remains, even if recordings aren't exploited maliciously. Addressing these concerns requires transparency, robust privacy settings, and ongoing scrutiny of voice recognition systems' accuracy and security measures.

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Protect your online accounts and data with the YubiKey 5 USB security key.</h1>
        <div class="noticia">
            <p>
                USB security keys, such as the YubiKey 5 developed by Yubico, offer a simple and secure solution for two-step verification and authentication. By connecting the USB key to a computer or mobile device, users can streamline the verification process without relying on additional applications or codes sent via SMS or email. The YubiKey 5 supports multiple authentication protocols, including U2F, making it compatible with various platforms and services like Google, Dropbox, Facebook, and Opera. It offers durable and secure protection against phishing, with the added benefit of being waterproof and bend-proof for portability. While purchasing two keys is recommended for backup in case of loss or theft, setting them up beforehand may require some initial configuration time. Nonetheless, USB security keys provide a convenient and effective defense against online threats.

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Nvidia has launched eight free courses aimed at helping users develop skills in Artificial Intelligence. </h1>
        <div class="noticia">
            <p>
                The courses cover a broad range of topics, including Generative AI, AI applications on the Jetson Nano, and video analytics using DeepStream. They also offer insights into building neural networks, enhancing language models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and accelerating data science workflows with GPUs. Additionally, there is a course focused on understanding AI in data centers, covering machine learning, deep learning, GPU architecture, and multi-system AI cluster requirements. While most courses are in English and vary in difficulty, they provide a thorough foundation for anyone interested in mastering AI technologies.

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Microsoft Introduces Recall: AI-Powered Replacement for Search History </h1>
        <div class="noticia">
            <p>
                When searching for products or services online, users often have to sift through numerous websites to find what they want, making search history a useful tool. Traditionally, search history logs all visited pages, aiding users in backtracking to previous searches. However, Microsoft's Recall leverages AI to record and remember all activities on the computer. When needed, users can describe what they're looking for in their own words, and the AI will quickly locate and present the desired web page or platform, similar to the "Rewind" feature on some Macs. For instance, users can request to find "the blue dress I looked at last week," and the AI will promptly display the specific webpage. Recall works with conversations, websites, articles, documents, videos, and more, and is expected to roll out to select Windows 11 ARM devices starting in June. Despite its convenience, this feature raises privacy concerns as it requires the AI to monitor and log all user activities.
