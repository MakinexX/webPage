                Google users took to social media to criticize erroneous answers generated by “AI Overviews” to questions such as whether people should eat rocks or look at the sun, or how many Muslim American leaders has been.<br>
                “We are taking rapid action where appropriate under our content policies and using these examples to develop broader improvements to our systems, some of which have already begun to roll out,” he concluded. Obama's example violated his policies and was removed, according to the spokesperson.

                The main characteristic of GPT-4o is that it interacts using image and voice. Additionally, it can laugh, sing, carry on a conversation, and even identify the user's sense of humor. <br>

                After the presentation of this model, comparisons with the science fiction film 'Her' have begun to arise. In fact, OpenAI has noted that this development can be seen as "a step forward towards a much more natural interaction between human and computer."<br>

                The similarities do not stop there, since one of the peculiarities of this tool is that it has a feminine tone similar to that of the actress Scarlett Johansson, who in the film lends her voice to the operating system on which the plot revolves.<br>

                And while the company has focused on taking a step forward in user experience, it has not been exempt from criticism for the implications behind this development.

        <h1>The technology that wants our brain to be eternal already exists, but it is not as simple as it seems</h1>

                In recent years, brain techniques based on neuromodulation have begun to emerge. That is, a practice that involves placing devices on our head that send electrical shocks to the nervous system and therefore nervous activity is altered through the electrical signals that are sent. It increases or decreases, as necessary, the activity of the regions of our brain, causing pain signals to be reduced or some nerves that were asleep to be excited. This is believed to help combat chronic headaches, epilepsy or Parkinson's. In principle, according to BBC ScienceFocus, these technologies are based on important studies from prestigious universities such as Harvard or University College London. <br>
                Be that as it may, several companies have emerged that are focusing their attention on these technologies. For now, the most promising has been Parasym, a company founded in 2017 and which has achieved the most success with its research, having put two products for sale on its website to treat different brain ailments.
