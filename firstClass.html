        <h1>Mia, artificial intelligence (AI), which can detect cancer</h1>
        <div class="noticia">
            <p>Mia it’s a tool of artificial inteligense(IA), that will help on  medicine to prevent sikcness like breast cancer, and was tested on one ten thousand women, to prove the efficiency detencting breast canser symptoms, was analized the  mammograms  although the majority had no anomalies, but this tool was able to detect the diagnosed patients, and eleven patients besides  there was a surprise since Mia detected eleven patients who were not detected by the doctors. But why the doctors didn’t detect the symptoms or the canser on patiens?. This happened because some anomalies in the breast tissue are very difficult to see or detect even for experts, since they are very small, almost invisible.<br>
            The project director Gerlat Lib, in his statements about the project and how it works, says that this tool can be a great help in medicine due to its efficiency compared to the limitations of doctors added to the normal distractions of their work, he also states that artificial intelligence is limited by the availability of mammograms since many are confidential, which is why it took more than five years to gather enough material to create this AI. <br>
            Implications works,  About this collective thought that many professionals or students have, that AI can replace them in their job, the proyect , Geral thinks that Mia is more of a friend than a threat because it would allow him to spend more time with patients instead of analyzing exams. Sometimes we don’t tink Sometimes we don't think about the advantages that AI brings, for example in this case without  the mia help, didn’t detect this tumors on patients and  these patients would not have been treated and the cancer would have worsened.
