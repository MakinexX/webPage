        <h1>ChatGPT will remove a voice 'eerily' similar to that of actress Scarlett Johansson</h1>

                ChatGPT will remove a voice 'disturbingly' similar to that of actress Scarlett Johansson
                OpenAI announced the suspension of the voice 'Sky' from its ChatGPT-4 platform due to its striking similarity to the voice of actress Scarlett Johansson. Although the company stated that it was never its intention to imitate Johansson's voice, this decision came after the actress rejected an offer to lend her voice to artificial intelligence. Johansson expressed surprise and annoyance at the similarity between her voice and 'Sky'. OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman explained that 'Sky's voice belonged to another actress and was not intended to sound like Johansson. However, out of respect for the actress, they decided to suspend the use of that voice in their products and apologized for the lack of communication.

                5G, universal connectivity and its implications
                Gigabit and 5G connectivity are crucial elements for industrial competitiveness and the digital and green transition. In addition, Telefónica ended 2023 with a notable deployment of 5G, with 3,951 nodes in the 3.5GHz band, which was more than doubling, even tripling, those of the competition. According to the Broadband Coverage Report in Spain, we exceed the European average, placing us slightly behind Germany and Italy.
                Likewise, it is estimated that 5G will reduce consumption per gigabyte by 90% in 2025 and by 95% between 2015 and 2021 and could save between 55 and 170 million tons of CO₂ per year.
                The opportunities offered by this technology:
                * Modern, more intelligent and software-based networks. 5G connectivity improves efficiency and speed in data transfer by offering interactive experiences, boosting productivity and user satisfaction. <br>
                * The massive connection capacity of 5G opens the door to the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and drives the integration of Edge computing: Smartcities, Connected Vehicles and interconnected devices will create a broader and more efficient digital ecosystem.<br>
                * Business innovation: Business applications ranging from augmented reality to industrial automation improve productivity and business models. <br>
                * The acceleration of private 5G deployments in various business verticals promises a growing market with significant opportunities.<br>
                * Adoption of wireless technologies for a more flexible and efficient connection.<br>

        <h1>Cybersecurity, challenges in the current panorama</h1>
        <div class="noticia">
            <p>
                
                The prolific use of AI has led to an increase in the number of vulnerabilities requiring innovative responses. Constantly evolving cyber threats demand more sophisticated solutions in advanced detection, cyber threat analysis, process automation with AI, strengthening cloud security, Ransomware resilience, multi-factor and biometric authentication, the need for collaboration to prevent attacks on supply chains, strengthening security for remote work, etc.
                INCIBE – National Cybersecurity Institute, points out that almost half of companies have suffered at least one attack in the last year 2023.
                According to a Gartner report, global spending on cybersecurity and risk management is expected to be about $215 billion in 2024, an increase of 14.3% from 2023. A large portion of the spending will focus on privacy of data and security in the cloud.
                Additionally, the global costs of damages caused by cybercrime could rise to $10.5 trillion by 2025. This contrasts with the $3 trillion it cost businesses in 2015.

        <h1>Edge Computing</h1>
        <div class="noticia">
            <p>
                The article highlights the concept of Edge Computing, which involves bringing business applications closer to data sources, such as IoT devices or local edge servers. This proximity to the data at its source offers benefits such as faster information acquisition, improved response times, and greater bandwidth availability. It is noted that the convergence of Edge Computing with technologies such as 5G, AI and security approaches such as Zero Trust, together with integration with the cloud, Edge-as-a-Service models and elements of energy sustainability, promise greater functionality and sustainability .

                The article also highlights statistics on the growth of spending on public cloud services and the projection of greater adoption of cutting-edge cloud technologies for European businesses. Opportunities such as Edge-as-a-Service for enterprises, integration between Edge Computing and the cloud, focus on data security, 5G adoption, decentralization of computing and real-time data analysis applications with AI are mentioned.

                Finally, the article concludes by inviting us to reflect on the construction of a future marked by inclusion, sustainability and collective well-being, driven by advances in technologies such as Edge Computing.
